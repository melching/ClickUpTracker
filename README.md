## üöÄ Running ClickUpTracker

You must build the app before running it for the first time. The provided `ClickUpTracker.app` is only a template and will not work until you build the project.

You can run ClickUpTracker in several ways, depending on your needs:

### 1. Create a Full .app Bundle (Recommended)

To build a complete, fully functional macOS app bundle:

```sh
./create-app-bundle.sh
```
This script builds the executable, creates a proper `.app` bundle with all required resources, and enables full macOS integration including system notifications and menu bar functionality.

### 2. Build and Run from Source (Development)

For development and testing without creating a bundle:

```sh
./build.sh
```
This script cleans, builds, and optionally launches the raw executable using Swift Package Manager. Note: The raw executable may lack some macOS integrations like notifications.

### 3. Run with Console Logging (Debugging)

To see all log output and debug API issues, use the provided script:

```sh
./run-with-logs.sh
```
This will show all `print()` statements and API call logs in your terminal.

### 4. Standard Run (after building)

- Double-click `ClickUpTracker.app` in Finder, or
- Run from Terminal:
  ```sh
  open ClickUpTracker.app
  ```

---

- All scripts must be run from the project root directory.
- For more details, see the comments in each script file.
